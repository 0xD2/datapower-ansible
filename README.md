Ansible & IBM DataPower Gateway (IDG)
==========================

Introduction
---------------

This repository is an **incubator** for the IDG modules for Ansible.
The architecture of the modules makes use of the XML and REST Management Interfaces.
The modules in this repository **may be broken due to experimentation or refactoring**.

The IDG modules for Ansible are freely provided to the open source community for automating IDG device configurations. 

Your ideas
----------

**We are very interested in your ideas!!!**

Please present us any error, question or request for improvement. What modules do you want created?, In what order? 
If you have a use case and can sufficiently describe the behavior you want to see, open an issue and we will hammer out the details.

Consider sending an email that introduces yourself and what you do. We love hearing about how you're using the IDG modules for Ansible.
